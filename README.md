# GalagaV - Project Dashboard & Game

A modern, arcade-themed project management dashboard built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Originally designed as a dashboard for a Galaga Clone game, it has evolved into a fully functional task management tool with sub-tasks, history tracking, and JSON import/export capabilities.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
-   npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn

### 1. Download Source
Ensure you have all project files (including `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `index.html`, and the `src` folder) in a directory.

### 2. Install Dependencies
Open your terminal/command prompt in the project folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run Locally
Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The terminal will show a URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`). Open this in your browser.

---

## ⚙️ Changing the Port

If port `5173` is busy or you want to use a specific port (e.g., `3000`), you can do so in two ways:

### Method 1: Command Line (Temporary)
Run the dev command with the `--port` flag:

```bash
npm run dev -- --port 3000
```

### Method 2: Config File (Permanent)
1.  Open `vite.config.ts` in the root directory.
2.  Locate the `server` block.
3.  Change the `port` value.

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    port: 3000, // <--- Change this number
    host: true,
  }
});
```

## ❓ Troubleshooting / Not Working?

If you run `npm run dev` and it's not working, check the following:

**1. "command not found"**
*   Ensure Node.js is installed. Type `node -v` in your terminal. It should print a version number (e.g., `v18.x.x`).

**2. White Screen / Blank Page**
*   Check the browser console (F12 -> Console).
*   If you see errors about "imports", ensure you ran `npm install`.

**3. "Address already in use"**
*   The port is taken. See the "Changing the Port" section above.

**4. Styles looking wrong?**
*   The app uses Tailwind CSS. The `index.html` includes a CDN link for quick prototypes, but `package.json` includes tailwind for production builds. If offline, the CDN link won't load.
*   **Fix:** Ensure you are connected to the internet for the first run, or setup a local Tailwind build process (included in `npm run build`).

## 📦 Building for Production

To create a static version of the app (HTML/CSS/JS) that you can upload to any web host:

1.  Run the build command:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2.  The output files will be created in the `dist/` folder.
3.  Upload the contents of `dist/` to your web server (Netlify, Vercel, Apache, Nginx, etc.).

## 🔑 Environment Variables (Optional)

Create a `.env` file in the root directory to enable external services:

```env
# Firebase Configuration (For Global High Scores)
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
...

# Google Gemini API (For AI Callsign Generation)
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key
```
